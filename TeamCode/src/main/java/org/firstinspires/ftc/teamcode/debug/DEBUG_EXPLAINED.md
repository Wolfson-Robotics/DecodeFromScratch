# Debug
Designed by Elijah Sarte

## Using it
- Look at ExampleDebug.java and how it works in order to use the debug movement system <br>
- Look at ReplayToInstructions in order to replay too instructions
- TODO: Update this once I figure out how it actually works

## How it works with the new system
Currently the TranslationBase holds many of the methods and variables needed for the debug system
to work. I migrated them from the old RobotBase and AutoBase classes and it should just work like normal.
